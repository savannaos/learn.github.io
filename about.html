      <blockquote>
      <p>Programming is creative <br></br>Programming is a tool for solving real-world problems <br></br>Programming has an impact on society</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2> About </h2>
      <p>LearnML hosts hands-on coding data science exercises and accompanying videos as part of my Georgia Tech OMSCS Educational Technology project.</p>

      <h2> Motivation </h2>
      Not all learning preferences are being met in Computer Science education. This limitation contributes to an exclusive environment that limits diversity in the field.
      Women especially prefer hands-on, social, tangible, and impactful learning, which programming can definitely provide!
      This project uses data analysis and machine learning exercises to measure effectiveness of these learning approaches.
      <h2>Principles </h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Programming is a shared feat!</b> Move away from the isolationist culture of programming with paired programming and team discussions in order to foster social learning.</li>
        <li><b>Apply what you learn!</b> Students engaged in active learning can apply and test what they know.</li>
        <li><b>Draw connections!</b> Relate exercises to their own experiences and to real-world problems in order understand where programmming fits in.</li>
        <li><b>Reflect!</b> Students who use metacognitive thinking can evaluate and guide their own learning</li>
        <li><b>Consistent feedback!</b> Assses student understanding in order to scaffold the learning process</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Resources </h2>
      There are already so many great resources for engaging more women and girls in the field. Here are some of my favorites:
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="https://code.org">Code.org</a></li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.csattfa.com">CS @ Teach for America</a></li>

      </ul>

      <b> A note about the site: </b> I made major simplifications to allow for time for content creation. That lead to the decisions to host the site on GitHub and to write virtually no JavaScript.
